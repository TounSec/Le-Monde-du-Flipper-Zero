## 🗝️Basic features 

In addition to its advanced features, *Flipper Zero* also offers basic features that make it versatile and convenient for everyday use.

It has a responsive screen and intuitive user interface, making it easy to navigate and interact with the tool. The battery performance is another notable advantage. 

</br>

## 🗝️ U2F (Universal 2nd Factor)

One of my daily favorite feature, the U2F. *Flipper Zero* supports the U2F standard, making it a handy tool for enhancing the security of your accounts. By using it as a U2F authentication device, you will add an extra layer of protection, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to your accounts.

</br>

## 🗝️ Frequency and signal analyzer

This tool offers the possibility of analyze and work with various radio frequencies. This allows you to explore and comprehend signals emitted by wireless devices such as remote controls, sensors, communication systems, etc. Thanks to its integrated signal analyzer, you can visualize and interact with different frequencies, opening the way to advanced applications.

With this functionality, you will be able, for example, to scan and analyze the different radio frequencies in a given environment. It will allow you to detect the frequencies used by wireless devices, such as remote controls, sensors, communication devices, as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

## 🗝️ Card emulation RFID/NFC

It has RFID/NFC card emulation functionality, allowing you to interact with access control systems and explore possibilities offered by this technology.

### 🔎 RFID

Use this feature, for example, to emulate a specific *RFID* card and test the security of access control systems. By emulating an authorized access card, you can verify whether the access control system is correctly configured and whether vulnerabilities exist, such as insecure card use, configuration errors, or weak communication protocols.

### 🔎 NFC

*NFC* technology can be used, for example, to emulate a specific contactless payment card. This allows you to simulate contactless payment transactions and analyze the communication protocols used between the contactless payment terminal and the emulated card. You can check are properly secured and if sensitive data is transmitted.

</br>

## 🗝️ Control of infrared devices

With its infrared device control function, *Flipper Zero* allows you to take control of many commonly used electronic devices, such as televisions, air conditioners, etc. You can create custom commands and perform actions remotely.

 
You can use this feature, for instance, to program and emulate various infrared remote controls. This emulation allows specific commands and actions to be simulated on infrared-controlled devices, facilitating security testing of such systems.
